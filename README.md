# Random Quotes Generator

Created as part of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum.

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/random-quotes-generator).

## Functionality

This is the [Random Quotes Generator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine) project, where I make a simple site that displays random quotes (pulled from [this GitHub gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/camperbot/5a022b72e96c4c9585c32bf6a75f62d9/raw/e3c6895ce42069f0ee7e991229064f167fe8ccdc/quotes.json)) and gives you the option to tweet them.

## Thoughts

It was probably overkill to do this in React, but I wanted to put it to use. It was a very simple project, and the only issues I ran into were in pulling the quotes data. I initially had some trouble because my components would try to display before the data was loaded, but eventually I got it all to work.

Also, this was my first time using Bootstrap in a project. It's nice to have so many ready-made components to use, but I think I still prefer the flexibility of something like Tailwinds or Tachyons.

God bless.
